# BuiltToLast
This repository will contain code for the paper "Built to Last: Functional and Structural Mechanisms in the Moth Olfactory Network that Mitigate Effects of Neural Injury" by CB Delahunt, PD Maia, and JN Kutz, August 2018. 
We are currently refactoring the Matlab for easier reading.

Full Matlab code for a related version of our moth brain model, that focuses on learning to read the MNIST dataset, is available at https://github.com/charlesDelahunt/puttingABugInML
