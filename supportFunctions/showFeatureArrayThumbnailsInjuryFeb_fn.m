% Show thumbnails of inputs used in the experiment.
% Inputs: 
%   1. featureArray = either 3-D (1 = cols of features, 2 = within class samples, 3 = class)
%                               or 2-D (1 = cols of features, 2 = within class samples, no 3rd dim)
%   2. numPerClass = how many of the thumbnails from each class to show.
%   3. normalize = 1 if you want to rescale thumbs to [0 1], 0 if you don't
%   4. titleString = string
%
% Note: This shows odors, which are 60 x 1, ie non-spatial. We plot them as a 6 x 10 rectangle.
